Screen has spotlight effect on the player where everything around you is dark, the area of
`brightness will continue to enlargen as you progress through the game
You will need to find you way through the levels, completing puzzles and defeating foes along the
`way
Enemies will approach you from the darkness, mainly in passageways and the front of larger rooms
Some rooms as mini-boss fights where you'll be locked in and waves of enemies will surround you
Some levels aren't explorative but solely for a large boss fight where the whole level is the
fighting stage

`your Will Guage will rise, everytime you get hit by an enemy your Will Guage will lower

You die upon your Will Guage reaching 0
There are no checkpoints, everytime you die you will get a failure screen & the option to start
`over from the beginning
At the end of each level in the location of where you enter the next, you can pause & save your
`current location to allow closing the program and then picking up where you left off the next
`time you play
The game's main menu will have a simplistic black screen design with a pulsing gem in the middle
`that represents your Will
In the level selection screen it will show locked harder difficulties

Title:
-Mentality Incarnate-

Enemies:
Based on different negative mental paths.
- Lost - unpredictable movement direction/attacks
- Doubt - generic/common, slow crawling
- Fright - generic/less common, quick/sudden
- Sadness - switches between idle sobbing and bursts of ranged crying (water gun) attacks, leaves puddles/lines of tears on ground as idle/moves
- Temptation - rare, lead you to loot but lead you away from the goal, if you keep following (fall for) temptations, goals will turn into chests instead when you reach them, moving the goal further away from you
- Ashamed - Weeping angel style?
- Confusion - Messes with vision?
- Paranoia - Creates ghosts/clones?
- Obsession - Tugs the player towards them in jolts every so often
- Resignation - Stone statues that do not let you past
- Cowardly - Runs away faster than the player can move, Requires luring into a location via
  `boxing them in?
- Depression - When in sight range, it will start to slow down your movement and attack speed until you reach a max slow multiplier. This multiplier can increase for each Depression enemy that sees you at the same time (kind of like stacking). When you defeat any one Depression enemy, you'll return to normal speed for a brief grafe period, then this will weat off and any other Depression enemies will start to slow you down again
- Self-Destructive - Blows up like a creeper upon getting close to you
Bosses:
- Arrogance?
- Twisted
- Karma
(expandable before final boss)
- Life - Final boss

Obstacles & Interactables:
- Gaps - Aspire over gaps
- Diamond Shaped 'Faith Jewels' - Hit these with your Incarnation to raise your Will Guage by a
  `large sum
- Infusing Orbs - Hold incarnation of will over orb to charge it up, slowly loses charge over
  `time, length it stays charged depends on how much/long you charge it up by with an upper limit,
  `used as sources that power things and stops powering them once they lose charge completely
- 

Story:
I want this game to be an incarnation of one's mentality where the goal is to struggle through
negative thoughts and battle your way to 'defeat life' and go beyond, believing in your own
power, your own will.
-Start-
Blank screen, fading text: tellings of how we have negative emotions, thoughts that block what's
really important.
